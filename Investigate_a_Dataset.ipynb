    "The chosen dataset has two tables one with population estimates and census counts and the other with gun records and permits across the 55 states of the USA. The gun data table includes columns subdivided between hand guns and long guns, that is, returns, rentals, redeemed, prepawn, and private. It also includes other details like permits. the ncis census data is mainly about population demographics across the 55 states between 1998 and 2017. This includes real population counts and predictions for estimates in the years after the counts.  \n",
